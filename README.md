# Advent of Code 2022

### About Advent of Code

```https://adventofcode.com/ ```

**Advent of Code** is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some **problem solving skills** will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.

### About me

It has been a while since I started watching people solve **Advent of Code** problems, and now I feel that I do have the required skills and knowledge to solve them too.

Disclaimer: My solutions are my own, and probably they are not the best way to solve theses problems.
